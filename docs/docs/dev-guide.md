For production protocol integration, start with [Integrations](/protocol/integrations), then use [SDK Utilities](/reference/sdk) and [Deployments](/deployments).

Two SDK details matter in current integrations: `contracts.getStateRoot(poolAddress)` reads the pool's `currentRoot()` for the state tree, while ASP proof root still comes from `onchainMtRoot` / `Entrypoint.latestRoot()`. For event reconstruction, initialize `DataService` with deployment `startBlock`.


## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v20 or later)
- Yarn (v1.22 or later)
- Foundry (for smart contracts)
- Docker (for running the relayer)
- Circom (for zero-knowledge circuits)

## Project Structure

The project is organized as a monorepo with the following packages:

- `contracts`: [Solidity smart contracts](/layers/contracts)
- `circuits`: [Zero-knowledge circuits](/layers/zk) in Circom
- `sdk`: [TypeScript SDK](/reference/sdk) for interacting with the protocol
- `relayer`: Note relayer service

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/0xbow-io/privacy-pools-core.git
cd privacy-pools-core
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

## Building and Testing Packages

### Contracts

The contracts package contains the Solidity smart contracts for the Privacy Pools protocol.

```bash
cd packages/contracts

# Build contracts
yarn build

# Run tests
yarn test

# Run unit tests
yarn test:unit

# Run integration tests
yarn test:integration

# Run coverage
yarn coverage

# Lint
yarn lint:check
yarn lint:fix
```

`yarn test` and `yarn test:integration` source `.env` if present and run Forge with `--ffi`, because the contract suite exercises external proof-generator helpers.

### Circuits

The circuits package contains the zero-knowledge circuits written in Circom.

```bash
cd packages/circuits

# Compile circuits
yarn compile

# Run tests
yarn test

# Run specific test suites
yarn test:merkle
yarn test:withdraw
yarn test:commitment

# Setup
yarn setup:all  # Sets up all circuits
yarn setup:ptau  # Generate Powers of Tau
yarn setup:withdraw  # Setup withdrawal circuit
yarn setup:commitment  # Setup commitment circuit
yarn setup:merkle  # Setup merkle tree circuit

# Generate groth16 verifier contracts
yarn gencontract:withdraw
yarn gencontract:commitment
```

### SDK

The SDK package provides TypeScript bindings for interacting with the protocol.

```bash
cd packages/sdk

# Build SDK
yarn build

# Build with circuit artifacts
yarn build:bundle

# Run tests
yarn test

# Run coverage
yarn test:cov

# Type checking
yarn check-types

# Lint and format
yarn lint
yarn format
```

### Relayer

The relayer package provides a service for relaying notes.

```bash
cd packages/relayer

# Build
yarn build

# Start the relayer
yarn start

# Build and start
yarn build:start

# Run with TypeScript
yarn start:ts

# Docker commands
yarn docker:build
yarn docker:run

# Tests
yarn test
yarn test:cov
```

## Environment Setup

Some packages require environment variables to be set.
