/**
 * Post-build script: prepends skills-core.md and skills.md to llms-full.txt
 *
 * The docusaurus-plugin-llms generates llms-full.txt from docs pages, but the
 * agent-facing files (skills-core.md and skills.md) live in static/ and aren't
 * included automatically.
 *
 * This script prepends both so llms-full.txt is fully self-contained:
 *   1. skills-core.md — concise operational quickstart (high-signal, low-context)
 *   2. skills.md — canonical deep reference (SDK, API schemas, ABIs, error handling)
 *   3. Original docusaurus-generated docs pages
 *
 * Agents that receive llms-full.txt can execute end-to-end without following
 * external URLs. The progressive structure lets truncated pipelines still get
 * the most critical content first.
